# Daisycon Synergy Tag for Google Tag Manager

The Daisycon Synergy Tag is an official Google Tag Manager (GTM) template designed to enable hybrid conversion tracking for advertisers who use server-side GTM. It plays an important role on the client side, helping link user clicks to server-side conversion events so your affiliate tracking stays accurate and complete.

## What it does

This tag works together with your server-side setup to support hybrid tracking. Here’s how it helps:

* **Hybrid Tracking support**: Fires a small tracking pixel from the user’s browser, including a unique Synergy Reference. This lets us match the client-side click to the conversion sent from your server.
* **Better Attribution**: Makes sure conversions tracked server-side are correctly linked to the original affiliate click, so publishers get the credit they deserve.
* **Fallback system**: If server-side attribution fails due to lost or otherwise unavailable click information, the client-side pixel acts as a fallback to preserve the attribution.

In short, it connects what happens in the user’s browser with what’s tracked on your server. That makes your setup more complete and helps avoid gaps in conversion data.
